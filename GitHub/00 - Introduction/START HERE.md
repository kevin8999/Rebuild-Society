# START HERE
If you are reading this, society has collapsed and that you would like to rebuild society technologically. In which case, you have come to the right resource. 

This repository contains all the knowledge needed to build the computers. A repository is a place that stores information.

This repository is divided into "documents". A document is a is a structured collection of information that is recorded and stored for communication, reference, or record-keeping. Each document has a title and sections that divide information within the document.

This document will go over the bare minimum needed to navigate this repository.

If you would like to download this repository, please see [DOWNLOADING](../../DOWNLOADING.md).

## Things to Know
First things first, we have some things we would like you to know.

We make the following assumptions.

First, you have nothing but this repository of knowledge.

Second, the Earth has no remnants of human technology left.

Third, you have a burning desire to advance humanity back to its technological peak.

Fourth, you have no background knowledge. If background knowledge is needed, we will let you know about the knowledge needed ahead of time.

Fifth, you can read English. If you understood everything so far, you're in good shape! If you ever encounter any words or phrases that you do not understand, we have attached a dictionary and grammar book to this repository that will explain their meaning.

All the technologies in this repository are practical. We will make recommended improvements that you can add to your technology to make work easier but understand that you may need to perform some improvements yourself.

Additionally, we assume that this will be the only place where you will be getting knowledge from.

## Writing Style
This section goes over the writing style used in this repository.

Firstly, all writing in this repository should be understandable to the average English speaker. Unless pre-requisites are *explicitly* stated, the reader is assumed to have no prior knowledge of the subject.

Additionally, "post-collapse" refers to a theoretical collapse of society. In this scenario, the people living in this age live *after* the "modern" age. "Modern" refers to the point in human history where we achieved a technological peak.

## Formatting
This repository uses several standards that you should familiarize yourself with. It is important to note that these formatting rules only apply to the repository and not external texts such as books.

### Headings
This repository uses headings to divide information into distinct sections.

Headings look like this:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

Heading 1 is the most general section, and heading 6 is the most specific section.

Headings guide readers through the content, signaling what each section is about and how it relates to the overall topic. They help break up the text into manageable chunks and provide a clear hierarchy of information. It improves readability, organization of content, and makes it easier to find information in the future.

### Horizontal Lines
You may occasionally run into horizontal lines such as these:

---

These horizontal lines help divide paragraphs of text that are not related to one another. This helps organize information in a way that's easier to navigate and understand, especially in longer texts

### Citations
If you see a small number with square brackets (such as these: [^citation]), they are placeholders that tell you to look at the "references section" at the end of the document. This section tells you where the information was found. It may also contain additional information that the reader might want to look at.

Post-collapse humans do not need to look at these references. They will not help you. 

For modern humans, we encourage you to look through these citations and to make corrections where they are needed. You may also fact-check us. Please note that this project uses APA 7 citations.

[^citation]: Hey! You found me!

### Lists
Lists are a way to organize and present information in a structured manner. They contain groups of information.

This repository use three different types of lists: ordered, unordered, and checklists.

---

An ordered list is a way of organizing items in a specific sequence or order. Each item in the list is given a number or another type of sequential marker to indicate its position in the list.

Here is an example of an ordered list:
1. Wake up
2. Have breakfast
3. Get dressed
4. Pack items
5. Leave for work or school

The sequence shows that "wake up" is done first. Then, "have breakfast" is done second. "Get dressed" is done third, and so on.

---

Unordered lists have a bullet point (the circle that appears before a line of text) before a block of information. It organizes items without any specific sequence or order.

Here is an example of an unordered list:
- Apples
- Oranges
- Mangoes
- Bread
- Milk

A list may also be listed out in a sentence. For example, one could say that the list above contains apples, oranges, mangoes, bread, and milk.

---

Checklists are a simple tool that helps you keep track of tasks. It's usually divided into sections, with each section containing an item on your list.

As you complete each task, you mark it off on the checklist by putting a slash or a check mark through the box. This helps you stay organized and ensures that you don't forget anything. It guides you through what needs to be done, step by step.

Here's an example checklist:
- [ ] Finish reading introduction
- [ ] Learn how to read books
- [ ] Plan out food and water needs

#### Indented Lists


### Admonitions
Admonitions look like this:

> [!note] Title of Admonition
> Admonitions are used to highlight any important information that you should know. They are placed in a different colored box so that they grab your attention.

There are 5 types of admonitions in total.

> [!note]
> Contains information you should know.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information that helps you do something better.

> [!important]
> Important information that you need.

> [!warning]
> Crucial information that informs you of any potential dangers and risks.

> [!caution]
> Warns of any potential negative consequences.

### Typefaces
Sometimes the text can look different. Examples of each typeface are given in this section.

Italics: text is slanted slightly to the right. Italicized text adds emphasis.
- *THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.*
- *the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.*
- *0123456789*

Bold: lines that make up the letters are thicker. Bold letters add greater emphasis than italicized text.
- **THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.**
- **the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.**
- **0123456789**

Monospace: creates letters that are equal in width. In our example below, it also adds a light background color for the text.

- `THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.`
- `the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.`
- `0123456789`

Serif: letters have small lines or extensions at the ends of their strokes. This is meant to make the text feel more formal or traditional.

- $\text{THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.}$
- $\text{the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.}$
- $01234546789$

This section of text you are reading right now is "sans-serif". Sans comes from the French language and means "without". So, "sans-serif" means "without serif". No additional lines or extensions are made at the end of a letter's stroke.

External resources in this repository use fonts that differ from this repository. We hope the fonts in those external resources will still be readable to you.

### Links
Some words have blue text and an underline [like this](https://google.com). These are "links". They are a reference to another resource.

Links can be separated into two categories: internal and external.

- Internal links reference a resource that is in this repository.
- External links reference a resource that is **not** in this repository. Post-collapse humans can safely ignore these.

External links begin with "http://" or "https://". Examples of external links are noted below:

- https://wikipedia.org/
- https://www.google.com/search?q=weather
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Post-collapse humans may safely ignore these types of links for now. Someday, you will understand what they mean.

---

Internal links are blue text and indicate the general title of the resource that you should view as reference or for more information. Special emphasis should be placed on "general title" because some of these resources may not have the same exact title when printed out.

As a reminder, this repository contains many textbooks written by other people. The majority of what you will learn will be contained in these textbooks. Because of this, you will need to learn how to access other resources.

- If you are accessing this repository digitally, clicking a link (either internal or external) will direct you to the resource automatically.
- If you are accessing this repository physically, you must learn how to locate these resources manually by reading the title of the document and looking for it in the repository.

As practice, try locating these resources now:

- [FM 21-76 US ARMY SURVIVAL MANUAL](../../Media/01%20-%20Survival/FM%2021-76%20US%20ARMY%20SURVIVAL%20MANUAL.pdf)
- [Dictionary](../../99%20-%20Unsorted%20Files/Dictionary.md)
- [Where There is No Doctor by David Werner](../../Media/01%20-%20Survival/Where%20There%20is%20No%20Doctor%20by%20David%20Werner.pdf)

Internal links may sometimes refer to a section within this document. Here, a "section" is defined as any heading within the document. When referring to sections inside a document, blue text will be followed by (or begin with) the word "section".

For example, you are currently in the [Links](#Links) section. The section before this is the [Citations](#Citations) section. The section after this is the [Tables](#Tables) section.

As practice, try locating these sections inside the document:

- [Things to Know](#Things%20to%20Know)
- [Typefaces](#Typefaces)
- [Writing Style](#Writing%20Style)

### Tables
A table is a structured arrangement of data, typically organized in rows and columns. It serves as a visual representation of information, allowing for easy comparison and analysis. This guide will provide a step-by-step approach to understanding how to read and interpret a table effectively.

Before diving into the interpretation of a table, it is essential to understand its basic components:

- **Title**: The title of the table is usually located at the top and describes the content or purpose of the table.
- **Columns**: Vertical sections of the table that contain related data. Each column is typically labeled with a header that indicates the type of information contained within.
- **Rows**: Horizontal sections of the table that represent individual records or entries. Each row corresponds to a specific item or observation.
- **Cells**: The individual boxes formed by the intersection of rows and columns. Each cell contains a specific piece of data related to the corresponding row and column.
- **Headers**: The labels at the top of each column that describe the data contained in that column. Headers provide context and help the reader understand what each column represents.

The image below gives you a general idea of what a table looks like.

[image]



To interpret a table:
1. **Read the Title**: this gives you an overview of the data.
2. **Examine headers**: the headers indicate the type of data presented.
3. **Analyze the rows**
4. **Compare data**: use information from the headers and values in the cells to compare data across different rows and columns. Look for patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.

An example of a table is given below:

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Title</b>: Name of Shapes</p>

| Drawing | Sides | Shape Name |
| :-----: | :---: | ---------- |
|   🔺    |   3   | Triangle   |
|   🔷    |   4   | Diamond    |
|    ⬛    |   4   | Square     |
|   🟥    |   4   | Rectangle  |
|    ⬢    |   6   | Hexagon    |

Let us examine this table.

1. **Title**: The title is "Name of Shapes", indicating that the table lists different food sources available throughout the year.
2. **Columns**: The columns of this table are
    - **Season**: Indicates the time of year (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).
    - **Food Source**: Lists the types of food available in each season.
    - **Location**: Describes where each food source can be found.
    - **Notes**: Provides additional information about the food source, such as its taste or how it is obtained.
3. **Rows**: Each row represents a different food source available in a specific season.
4. **Cells**: The cells contain descriptive information that provides context about the food sources and their locations.

## End of Introduction
Congratulations, you've reached the end of the introduction! At this point, we recommend checking out the [Dictionary](../../99%20-%20Unsorted%20Files/Dictionary.md) in case you encounter a word that you do not understand.
