# Introduction to Mathematics
Mathematics (also known as "math") explores measurement, properties, quantities, and sets, using symbols.

Mathematics is a very important tool to understanding the world around you. It is also needed to navigate documents and books in this repository.

Mathematics will later be used to understand and solve many problems across many fields of study.

Please feel free to skip ahead if you believe you know some of the math already.

Note that most of the math has been outsourced to textbooks with generous copyright licenses. You may end up needing to carry several textbooks with thousands of pages in them. But, they are very important for more advanced technologies, so keep them safe!

You may now move on to [1 - Basic Mathematics](Mathematics/1%20-%20Basic%20Mathematics.md).
