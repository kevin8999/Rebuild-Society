# 3 - Geometry
  
Geometry is a branch of math that's all about studying shapes and sizes. It looks at points (dots), lines, angles, and shapes like triangles and circles. Here are the basics:

1. **Points:** Think of them as tiny dots with no size.
2. **Lines:** Straight paths going on forever, made by connecting two points.
3. **Angles:** Corners made by two lines meeting.
4. **Polygons:** Shapes with straight sides, like triangles or squares.
5. **Circles:** Shapes made by points that are the same distance from a center point.

Why does it matter? Well, it can be used to explain things that happen in our world. It is also used in other fields such as architecture.

## Protractors

Protractors are useful for measuring angles in degrees. This is an example image[^protractor] of a protractor:

Looking at the half-circle, you might've noticed that it only contains 180° (or, 180 degrees). Now, if you put two half-circles together, you get a full circle, which also means that a full circle is 360°.

### Radians
Radians (may be abbreviated as $\text{rad}$) are an alternative way to measure the measure of a circle. It is commonly used in more advanced mathematics and engineering. Unlike degrees, which most people are familiar with, radians are based on the radius of a circle.

As an analogy, imagine a circle, and you're standing at the center. Now, draw a line from the center to the edge – that's your radius. If you move along the circle's edge, creating an angle, the measure of that angle in radians is the length of the arc you've traveled, divided by the radius.

You will learn a lot more about radians while learning [Precalculus](Mathematics/4%20-%20Precalculus.md). However, we placed this section in early in case you need to use it at some point.

As an equation, radians are measured using:
$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$

where
- $\theta$ is the angle measure in radians
- $s$ is the arc length (the length of the curve that you traveled)
- $r$ is the radius (the distance from the center to the edge of the circle)

The full circumference of a circle is equal to $2 \pi$ radians.

You can also convert between degrees and radians.

To convert from radians to degrees, multiply your angle measure by this conversion factor:

$$\frac{180 \degree}{{\pi}} \approx 57.296 \degree$$

> [!example] Example
> Convert $1.5 \pi$ to degrees.
> $$1.5 {\pi} \cdot \frac{180 \degree}{ {\pi}}$$
> $$1.5 \cancel{\pi} \cdot \frac{180 \degree}{2 \cancel{\pi}}$$
> $$1.5 \cdot 180 \degree$$
> $$270 \degree$$

To convert from degrees to radians, multiply the angle by this conversion factor:
$$\frac{\pi}{180 \degree}$$

When doing conversions, make sure you put the unit you want to get rid of in the denominator.
