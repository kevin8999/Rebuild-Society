# 1 - Basic Mathematics
This document goes over the most basic math you need to survive.

## Sets
In mathematics, "sets" are groups of objects.

If a set has objects, it must have a certain amount of those objects. For example, the image below has a single "O".

![](Media/One%20Circle.png)

This "O" is called a "circle" in mathematics.

Sets can contain any amount of objects, ranging from having no objects to having many objects. For example, suppose we place another circle into the set.

![](Media/Two%20circles.png)

The two circles are now part of the same set.

Sets can have any amount of objects. They can have no objects, or they can have many objects.

In mathematics, you can define more than one set at a time. We will represent this simply by placing them inside certain colored areas.

![](Media/Two%20sets.png)

The red set and blue set both have circles inside them.

In the sets above, we used circles as a simple example. Sets can contain *any* object.

## Numbers
Numbers represent the amount of objects in a set. To represent this, we use special symbols called "Arabic numerals".

A numeral is a symbol used to represent the amount of objects in a set. The image below shows you the Arabic numerals:

![](Media/Arabic%20Numerals%201-9.svg)

Each set contains one more circle than the one before it. Similarly, the numbers you see on the left is one greater than the one before it and correspond to the amount of circles in the set to its right.

To represent a set with no circles in it, we use the numeral, "0". It should be important to emphasize that the set still exists, even if there are no objects in it.

As an example, if I say, "there are 0 trees", then I am saying that there are no trees.

Each numeral may also be written out as word as well. This table quickly summarizes how each numeral is represented as a word.

| Word  | Number | Circle Representation |
| ----- | :----: | --------------------- |
| Zero  |   0    |                       |
| One   |   1    | O                     |
| Two   |   2    | O O                   |
| Three |   3    | O O O                 |
| Four  |   4    | O O O O               |
| Five  |   5    | O O O O O             |
| Six   |   6    | O O O O O O           |
| Seven |   7    | O O O O O O O         |
| Eight |   8    | O O O O O O O O       |
| Nine  |   9    | O O O O O O O O O     |

### The Number Line
A number line is a straight line that shows numbers in order. It helps us understand how numbers relate to each other.

A number line has many "tick marks". Tick marks on a number line are small lines or marks that are used to indicate specific numbers or intervals. Tick marks are equally spaced from one another. This make it easier to read the number line.

An image of a number line is shown below:

![Number Line](Media/Number%20Line.svg)

You may have noticed a "<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">▸</span>" on the right end of the number line. This is called an "arrow head". It signifies that the number line continues beyond the number 9.

To see how numbers are represented past 9, please see the [Place Values](#Place%20Values) section in this document.

### Place Values
Place values denote numbers greater than 9.

## Distance
Distance measures the space between two objects.

## Area


## Angles
An angle measures the difference in direction two lines point. The space where the two lines meet is called the "vertex" of the angle.

## Temperature
Temperature measures how hot or cold the environment feels.

Temperature can be measured using a tool called a "thermometer". Since you do not know how to make this tool, we will 

| Temperature (°C) | Description of Feeling                          | Survival Recommendation                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 0°C                | Freezing; feels very cold                      | Seek shelter and insulation to prevent hypothermia. |
| 10°C               | Cool; might feel chilly                        | Layer clothing to retain body heat; find windbreaks. |
| 20°C               | Mild; comfortable for most                     | Stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure to cold. |
| 25°C               | Warm; nice summer day                          | Stay hydrated; seek shade to avoid heat exhaustion. |
| 30°C               | Hot; feels warm, especially in sunlight        | Limit activity during peak heat; find water sources. |
| 35°C               | Quite hot; can feel oppressive                 | Stay in shaded areas; use wet cloths to cool down. |
| 40°C               | Extremely hot; uncomfortable and dangerous     | Stay indoors; ration water and avoid exertion.   |

## Next Steps
You should now have a basic grasp of mathematics and basic applications of it. This information is enough to navigate the information in this vault as well as provide a basic understanding for [0 - Basic Survival Skills](../01%20-%20Survival/0%20-%20Basic%20Survival%20Skills.md).

However, you are not done yet. At this point, you should read and complete the following chapters in [Fundamentals of Mathematics](Mathematics%20Media/Fundamentals%20of%20Mathematics.pdf):

- [ ] Chapter 1: Addition and Subtraction of Whole Numbers
- [ ] Chapter 2: Multiplication and Division of Whole Numbers
- [ ] Chapter 4: Introduction to Fractions and Multiplication and Division of Fractions
- [ ] Chapter 5: Addition and Subtraction of Fractions, Comparing Fractions, and Complex Fractions
- [ ] Chapter 6: Decimals
- [ ] Chapter 9: Measurement and the United States System

It is also strongly recommended you complete the following chapters at some point:

- [ ] Chapter 8: Techniques of Estimation
- [ ] Chapter 9: Measurement and Geometry
