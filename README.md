## Project Vision

The goal of this project is to provide the knowledge necessary to make computers starting from nothing (other than this repository). This project aspires to serve as a foundation for future generations to restore and rebuild civilization to its former state should it ever collapse in the future.

This project has the following principles in mind:

1. **Simplicity**: using only this repository, one should be able to learn the knowledge needed to reinvent all previous human technologies.
2. **Practicality**: all technologies described will *only* be used to increase productivity or increase overall quality of life.

The only assumption made is that the reader can read English.

## Roadmap
This is the general path you will need to take if you want to advance humanity. Each step may also contain further sub-steps that need to be completed.
